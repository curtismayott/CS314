CS314 Assignment #1

Sean Mann
Tyler Kuntz
Curtis Mayott

Design approaches is something we need to work on. 
Both Tyler and Sean worked on one method, which was unnecessary.
Project/GitHub setup was time consuming - need to get used to it.
This assignment seemed to be too simple to do as a team (<100 lines of code for 3 people), this is a reason as to why it was difficult to split up the work effectively.


Specific contributions:

	Curtis:Initialized GitHub for team, helped with setup on other machines, wrote all test cases and test controller (AllTest.java), methods written in Vector3D: constructor, scale, add, and equals.

	Sean: Implemented subtract and magnitude methods.

	Tyler:

Time spent:

	Curtis: 1 hour - github/project setup; 1.5 hours - test cases written and made to work; 5 minutes - functions in Vector3D.

	Sean:

	Tyler:
