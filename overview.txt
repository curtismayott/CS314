CS314 Assignment #1

Sean Mann
Tyler Kuntz
Curtis Mayott

Design approaches is something we need to work on. 
	-Both Tyler and Sean worked on one method, which was unnecessary. Need to split up work and communicate.
	-Project/GitHub setup was time consuming - need to get used to it.
	-This assignment seemed to be too simple to do as a team (<100 lines of code for 3 people), this is a reason as to why it was difficult to split up the work effectively.


Specific contributions:

	Curtis:Initialized GitHub for team, helped with setup on other machines, wrote all test cases 		and test controller (AllTest.java), methods written in Vector3D: constructor, scale, add, and equals.

	Sean: Implemented subtract, magnitude, and toString methods and test cases.

	Tyler: Wrote dot and negate methods in Vector3D.

Time spent:

	Curtis: 1 hour - github/project setup; 1.5 hours - test cases written and made to work; 5 minutes - functions in Vector3D.

	Sean: 90 minutes.

	Tyler: 30 minutes.
